Twitch search and recommendation system.
- Built web pages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to search Twitch resources and get recommendations.
- Created Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Used MySQL to store user preferences (favored videos etc.) and deployed to Amazon RDS for better simplicity and scalability.
